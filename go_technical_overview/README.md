# A Technical Overview of Golang

This presentation was put together for the Programming Language User Group (PLUG), an internal Pearson meetup. This deck was meant to be a technical introduction of the language for engineers, and took almost to hour to present (including questions).

This presentation can be viewed [online](http://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/davelaursen/presentations/go_technical_overview/go_technical_overview.slide), but you will get the best results if you download and run it locally. To view it locally, make sure that you have installed [Go](http://golang.org/doc/install.html) and the Go Present tool:

	go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/present

I have overridden the base Go Present stylesheet - to view it with the custom styles applied, run the present tool with the following command from this directory:

	present -base=present
